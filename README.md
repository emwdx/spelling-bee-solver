This is a Swift Playground file that solve the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle. 

The game consists of a seven cell hive of hexagons, each containing a single letter. The player must create words of more than three letters from the letters in the cell, each containing the letter in the center cell of the hive. Letters can be used more than once. 
 
 The idea of the program below is to use the auto-complete capability built into iOS to check random combinations of letters for words containing the letters in the hive. The print statements at the bottom of the program list the words that are 4, 5, and more than 5 letters in length. 
 
 To search for words that are not in English, the two letter code after language can be changed. The list of codes at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes is a way to find the correct code for another language, though not all languages have autocomplete in iOS.
 
 It goes without saying that this takes most of the fun out of the game. This was a feasibility study to see if the autocomplete function would be an effective way to reduce the search space and find a solution in a short amount of time. The test puzzle was solved in just over ten seconds.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
